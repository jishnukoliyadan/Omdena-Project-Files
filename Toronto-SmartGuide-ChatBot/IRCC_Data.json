Since co-signers must be included in all years, she must include Diego in the family size for all 3 years even though they married in 2021.

He has no dependants. Naya separated from her husband, Jai, in 1995. Neither Naya nor Jai are in a common-law relationship with another person. For 2021, 2020 and 2019, Kabir\u2019s family size is 3: Kabir Kabir\u2019s mother, Naya Naya\u2019s spouse, Jai (even though they\u2019re separated) Even though Naya and Jai separated in 1995, they\u2019re still legally married. Jai counts towards the family size until they\u2019re divorced or one of them enters a common-law relationship with another person For all 3 years (2021, 2020 and 2019), Kabir must check if he meets the income requirement for 3 persons.Example 7 \u2014 Principal applicant with a separated spouse and a common-law partner Fatima is sponsoring her father Yusuf and will be submitting an application in 2022.
